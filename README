The goal of this project is facilitate the use of java libraries
on racket, by making it easier to write manual bindings and 
by also providing support for automatic binding

the project is currently experimental, its api is inconsistent,
and subject to drastic change, lacks complete documentation,
and sufficient unit testing

some documentation may be found in the scribblings folder
for more examples on how to use the library you can check the tests/
folder 

Installation:
make sure to have the JAVA_HOME and ARCH variables set,
place in collects folder, then run "raco setup jrffi"

Troubleshooting:
if you get one of the error messages below 
(libjava.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)
(libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)
you'll have to either set the jre path in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
or hard define it in your ld.conf.d directory

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64:$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/server
